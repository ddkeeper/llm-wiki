# LLM Wiki

!!! info "About this Wiki"
    This knowledge base is built upon and extends [Maximilian Labonne's LLM course](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course).
    Thanks to the original author for the open-source contribution!

Welcome to LLM Wiki! This is a comprehensive site focused on Large Language Model (LLM) knowledge. The content currently includes three main sections:

## 🧩 LLM Fundamentals

![LLM Fundamentals Roadmap](assets/images/roadmap_fundamentals.png)

This section covers the essential knowledge required for building and understanding large language models, including:

* Mathematics Fundamentals
* Python Programming Basics
* Neural Networks Fundamentals
* Natural Language Processing Basics

!!! note "Note"
    The fundamentals section is optional. If you already have the relevant knowledge, you can proceed to the subsequent chapters. However, a solid foundation will help you better understand and apply LLM technology.

## 🧑‍🔬 LLM Scientist
