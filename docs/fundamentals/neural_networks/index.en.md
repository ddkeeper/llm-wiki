# Neural Networks

Neural networks are a fundamental part of many machine learning models, particularly in the realm of deep learning. To utilize them effectively, a comprehensive understanding of their design and mechanics is essential.

## Fundamentals

This includes understanding the structure of a neural network such as:

* Layers
* Weights
* Biases
* Activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, etc.)

## Training and Optimization

Familiarize yourself with:

* Backpropagation
* Different types of loss functions, like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy
* Various optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, RMSprop, and Adam

## Overfitting

Understand the concept of overfitting (where a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data) and learn various regularization techniques to prevent it:

* Dropout
* L1/L2 regularization
* Early stopping
* Data augmentation

## Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Implementation

Build an MLP, also known as a fully connected network, using PyTorch.
