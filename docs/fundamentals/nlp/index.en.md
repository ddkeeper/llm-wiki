# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating branch of artificial intelligence that bridges the gap between human language and machine understanding. From simple text processing to understanding linguistic nuances, NLP plays a crucial role in many applications like translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and much more.

## Learning Content

**Text Preprocessing**: Learn various text preprocessing steps like tokenization (splitting text into words or sentences), stemming (reducing words to their root form), lemmatization (similar to stemming but considers the context), stop word removal, etc.

**Feature Extraction Techniques**: Become familiar with techniques to convert text data into a format that can be understood by machine learning algorithms. Key methods include Bag-of-words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and n-grams.

**Word Embeddings**: Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meanings to have similar representations. Key methods include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.

**Recurrent Neural Networks**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to work with sequence data. They include basic RNN structures and variants like LSTMs and GRUs that are capable of learning long-term dependencies.

## Learning Suggestions

1. Start with basic text preprocessing, as it forms the foundation for all NLP tasks;
2. Understand traditional feature extraction methods, which remain valuable in certain scenarios;
3. Master modern word embedding techniques, which are central to NLP in the deep learning era;
4. Finally, learn sequence models, as they are crucial for understanding the Transformer architecture.
